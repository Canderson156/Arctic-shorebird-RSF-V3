         Sub_region_name, #170 plots with NAs. 89 as above. 78 in Foxe basin becasue of differences in how subregions were calculated over time (2019 had no subregions). 3 in North Archipelago are confusing, but may stem from weird subregions that overlap near Alert (see email from Laurent RE Tyler's map of subregions)
